# PaperHopper

PaperHopper is a prototype medium for experimenting with how our environment changes how we design.

Initially developed with _Metatool_, a class taught at Columbia GSAPP in Fall 2018. 

Heavily inspired by [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/).

Developed to be used with Rhino/Grasshopper, PaperHopper is somewhere between tool and medium.

## Setup

### Hardware

(More details to come)

Required hardware:
- A table with a light-ish surface. The maximum size will depend on the projector throw distance and the webcam angle of view.
- People
- Webcam.
  - The more resolution, the better, and also the slower. 1920x1080 at 24fps is ideal. The Logitech Brio is a stellar webcam.
  - The webcam may need some modification to make it into an infrared webcam.
- Projector. 
  - The more lumens, the better. Having a throw ratio of around 0.5 - 1.2 is necessary to get a wide image with a short distance.
- A fast computer with good CPU clock speed. 
  - Grasshopper works on the CPU, and is mostly single-threaded.
