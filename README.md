# PaperHopper

PaperHopper is a medium for prototyping experiments around how our environment changes how we design.

Developed to be used with Rhino/Grasshopper.

Initially developed with _Metatool_, a class taught at Columbia GSAPP in Fall 2018. 

Heavily inspired by [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/).
