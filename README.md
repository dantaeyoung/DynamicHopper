# PaperHopper

PaperHopper is a prototype medium for experimenting with how our environment changes how we design.

Initially developed with _Metatool_, a class taught at Columbia GSAPP in Fall 2018. 

Heavily inspired by [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/).

Developed to be used with Rhino/Grasshopper, PaperHopper is somewhere between tool and medium.

## Setup

### Hardware

(More details to come)
Required hardware:
- Webcam with at least 1920x1080, 24fps. The Logitech Brio is a stellar webcam.
  - The webcam may need some modification to make it into an infrared webcam.
- Projector. The more lumens, the better. Having a throw ratio of around 0.5 - 1.2 is necessary to get a wide image with a short distance.
- A fast computer with good CPU clock speed. Grasshopper works on the CPU, and is mostly single-threaded.

In this iteration, PaperHopper is eses
